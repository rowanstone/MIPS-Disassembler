# MIPS-Disassembler
MIPS Disassembler written in Python

To run our project on Linux, first change to the directory that the project zip file is located.  In the zip file you will find the executable python program, 
team7_project3.  The zip file also has the test file we used used, and the two output files generated by disassembler and pipeline, team7_out_dis.txt and 
team7_out_pipeline.txt.  To run the python file, use the command "$ python team7_project3.py -i test1_bin.txt -o team7_out". The disassembler will take test1_bin.txt 
in binary code and the disassembler will decode the opcodes, after BREAK it will calculate the 2's complement.  The simulator class will produce a cycle-by-cycle 
simulation showing the processor state at each cycle.  The processor state includes the contents of registers, buffers, cache, and data memory at each cycle.  This 
information prints to the output file, team7_out_pipeline.txt.
